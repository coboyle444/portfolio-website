            <h2> About Me </h2>
            <p> My name is Courtlyn O'Boyle and I grew up in the small hamlet of Sherwood Park, Alberta. I was born on February 1st, 2000 and remained in Sherwood Park up until July of 2024. I was raised alongside two older brothers which makes me rather competitive, though I would never admit that. </p>
            <p>
                My hobbies as a child included dancing, singing, and creating videos. As an adult, I have grown to enjoy Twitch streaming, gaming, and anything that allows me to exercise the creative part of my brain.
            </p>
