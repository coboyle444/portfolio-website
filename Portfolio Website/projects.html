   I created this image in 2017 in photography class under the format of double exposure. Double exposure involves layering two images into one, typically with a silhouetted effect. The stairway in the background was from my high school, evoking a sense of feeling trapped in an institution like school. (I would like to assure that I do, actually, love school.)

    Another prompt in high school was taking and editing that of an HDR landscape. HDR photos involve taking them at different ISO levels and layering them overtop of each other to create an extra-saturated look.

    This was my attempt at learning how to sketch digitally. In the height of the pandemic, I decided to buy an iPad and an Apple Pencil and go to town with silly little drawings like this one.

    Along the same theme of dogs, I tried my hand at creating collages. I enjoy experimenting with more of a hands-on medium like physically cutting out photos from National Geographic books and gluing them together for a new art piece.

    In my Web Communications class, I was tasked to create a pitch for a floral delivery service in Calgary. This was my design for a logo that featured bright colors and evoked a sense of whimsy.

    The logo that you see at the <a href="#top">top</a> of the page is something I created for my Visual Design class.
